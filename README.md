# Purpose: Export spreadsheets in Excel or CSV format into Campaign Logger

This project  is a simple GUI application that
allows the User to choose a spreadsheet workbook and a table
within that workbook. It will then convert this table into
Campaign Logger's table format (a combination of Markdown and
YAML). The User will be able to name the output textfile and
destination directory.

__Note:__ This program always overwrites the destination textfile.

The program will provide useful feedback on any problems discovered during
content conversion.

If you do not wish to use the basic code in a python virtual environment,
you may download just the main.exe in the dist subdirectory. It is a
standalone executable.
